# SaladeScraper

This is a very cool web scraper written in go (and python, btw)
I think go is pretty cool for this kind of task (it was probably designed for it too(python is goo too)).

# Usage

```bash
# use the go version
cd go/
go build
./saladescraper `url`
# OR, use the python version
cd python/
python3 ./saladescraper.py `url`
```

# Future
- For now, the output is still html. I think it would be cool if it outputted markdown
- include title
- make big bucks
