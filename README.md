# SaladeScraper

This is a very cool web scraper written in go.
I think go is pretty cool for this kind of task (it was probably designed for it too).

# Usage

```bash
go build
./saladescraper `url`
```

# Future
- For now, the output is still html. I think it would be cool if it outputted markdown
- include title
- make big bucks
