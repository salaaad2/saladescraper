<div class="body markup"><p>Happy New Year! After receiving my nth complaint, this one reading:</p><blockquote><p><em>I subscribe to your substack solely for the poetry. I (perhaps unfortunately) don't have much of an interest in political history or that side of things.</em>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I have relented. Future verse will appear on a separate free stack, <a href="https://imperialmelodies.substack.com/p/coming-soon" rel="">Imperial Melodies</a>. The scourge of poetry will no longer disrupt “political history or that side of things.” If you are only here for the four-stressed lines, unsub here and subscribe over there.</p></div></div><div></div><div class="
